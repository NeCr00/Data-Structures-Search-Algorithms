# Data Structures and Search Algorithms

This repository contains a set of C programs developed for a university project. The project's goal is to learn about data structures and search algorithms.

The following files are included in this repository:

-   `BST1.c`: This file contains a program that implements a binary search tree data structure.
-   `BST2_Mark.c`: This file contains a program that implements a balanced binary search tree data structure.
-   `HASH.c`: This file contains a program that implements a hash table data structure.
-   `Search-Algorithms.c`: This file contains a program that implements various search algorithms such as linear search, binary search, and interpolation search.
-   `Sort-Algorithms.c`: This file contains a program that implements various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
-   `test.txt`: This file contains sample data used to test the programs.

## Usage

To use these programs, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Compile the desired C program using a C compiler such as GCC.
3.  Run the compiled program using the command prompt or terminal.
